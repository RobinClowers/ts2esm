# ts2esm

Fixes your relative TypeScript imports automatically, converting them into ESM-compatible imports with explicit `.js` file extensions. ü™Ñ

![Automate all the things](./automate.webp)

## Example

Turns:

```ts
import {RESTClient} from './client/RESTClient';
```

Into:

```ts
import {RESTClient} from './client/RESTClient.js';
```

## Installation

Simply run this command to install `ts2esm` globally on your machine:

```bash
npm i -g ts2esm
```

Afterwards, just launch the program inside the directory of your TS project (it will ask you for your `tsconfig.json`):

```bash
ts2esm
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Make sure you have a backup (in Git or similar) of your code as this program will modify your source code.

## How it works

The `ts2esm` program adjusts your relative imports, adding extensions like `index.js` or `.js` to make them ESM-compatible. Say goodbye to import errors such as [**TS2835**](https://typescript.tv/errors/#ts2835)!

> error TS2835: Relative import paths need explicit file extensions in EcmaScript imports when '--moduleResolution' is 'node16' or 'nodenext'. Did you mean './client/RESTClient.js'?

This program was born from an [inspiring conversation](https://twitter.com/bennycode/status/1693362836695585084) I had with [Basarat Ali Syed](https://twitter.com/basarat). I recommend checking out [Basarat's coding tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@basarat). üëç
